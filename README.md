# Fire-Force

Fire-Force is an embedded safety system designed to monitor both eye and head movement of a vehicle driver in real time. Its primary objective is to detect dangerous conditions such as drowsiness, loss of consciousness, or coma-like inactivity.

When an abnormal or unsafe event is detected, the system operates in multiple stages:

## Driver Alert Stage
The system activates a buzzer and an LED indicator to warn the driver and request an immediate response.

## Fail-Safe Stage
If the driver does not respond within a defined safety window, the system automatically:

Reduces the vehicle’s speed to a safe level.

Sends an emergency message containing the vehicle’s GPS coordinates to the appropriate emergency contact or service.

This project aims to enhance driver safety and reduce the risk of accidents caused by fatigue, drowsiness, or medical emergencies.
